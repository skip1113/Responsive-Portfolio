      <p>My name is Skip Kamvongsa, I live in Westminster Colorado and I have a Pembroke Welsh Corgi names Daisy. I work as a operations technician and make medical device grafts with donated human tissue.</p>
      <p>My hobbies are i love to camp, fish, go to the range, hike, and just live me life. life is too short to not do anything and just work. A great motto that ive learned and i know its been around for a while but its "work life balance" or "work hard play hard."</p>
      <p>I have learned that working hard and being self motivated while still being humble will get me place, but it will take time. Im giving my 110% with everything i do wether its work or studying, I can accomplish anything that I put my head to.</p>
